Title: Experiment 2 – Live Word Counter, Dynamic Product Filter & SVG Drawing Tool

Defined Approach :-

In this experiment, three interactive web applications were developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand real-time UI updates and user interactions in front-end development.

Experiment 2.1 (Live Word Counter) was implemented using a textarea input where the word count updates dynamically as the user types. JavaScript was used to track user input and calculate total words, helping in understanding real-time DOM manipulation.

Experiment 2.2 (Dynamic Product Filter) was created by designing product cards and using a dropdown filter to display products based on category. JavaScript array filtering logic was applied to update the displayed items instantly, improving knowledge of data handling and UI rendering.

Experiment 2.3 (SVG Drawing Tool) was designed using an SVG canvas where users can draw circles by clicking on the canvas. Features like color selection, undo option, and circle counter were added using JavaScript event handling, which helped in understanding interactive graphics and dynamic element creation.

This complete experiment strengthened the understanding of modern UI development concepts such as event handling, DOM updates, filtering logic, and interactive SVG graphics.
